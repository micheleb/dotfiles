What's in here
==============

My conf files for vim, tmux, and zsh (I use [oh my zsh][1]).

How this setup looks like
-------------------------

Right now, it looks like this:

    <img src="https://github.com/micheleb/dotfiles/raw/master/tmux-vim-screen.png" alt="Grayscale FTW">
</p>

Mostly gray / toned down, but still not quite there.

What I'm using
--------------

* a modified version of [the agnoster theme][2] for zsh (included in
the `.oh-my-zsh/themes` folder, copy it to your home and update `ZSH_THEME` in
your `.zshrc` to `agnoster-gray`. Don't forget to also include the
[zsh-256color][3] plugin to your zsh)
* [my fork of the preto theme][4] for vim
* a grayscale-by-default color theme for vim powerline; find it inside
the `.config/powerline/colorschemes` folder, copy it inside your home folder --
it's a work in progress, modes are still too colorful right now
